# Form Validation

A simple form validation script to ensure user input meets specified criteria.

## Overview

This project consists of a form with validation checks for full name, phone number, email, and message fields. The validation is performed using JavaScript, and error messages are displayed dynamically based on user input.

## Validation Criteria

- **Full Name:** Checks if the name is not empty and contains both first and last names.
- **Phone Number:** Ensures the phone number is exactly 10 digits long and contains only numeric characters.
- **Email:** Verifies if the email format is valid.
- **Message:** Limits the message length and provides feedback on the remaining characters required.

## Features

- **Dynamic Validation:** Error messages are displayed in real-time as the user types.
- **Visual Feedback:** Utilizes FontAwesome icons to indicate valid input fields.
- **Submit Validation:** Prevents form submission if any validation errors are present.
- **Responsive Design:** Designed to adapt to various screen sizes for a seamless user experience.

## Usage

To use the form validation:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Fill in the form fields and observe the validation messages.
3. Submit the form only when all fields are filled correctly.

## Files

- **index.html:** Contains the HTML structure of the form with input fields and error spans.
- **style.css:** Provides styles for the form layout and error messages.
- **script.js:** Implements the form validation logic using JavaScript.

## Contributions

Contributions to enhance the form validation functionality are welcome! If you have any suggestions, improvements, or bug fixes, feel free to fork the repository, make the changes, and submit a pull request.
